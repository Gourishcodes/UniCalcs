 **UniCalcs**

A small student calculator website.

Built as an **experimental project** vibecoded heavily and surprisingly functional.

## What’s in here

A few tools students actually end up Googling anyway:

- CGPA ↔ Percentage
- Semester GPA
- Attendance calculator (the “can I skip class” one)
- Marks to grade
- Backlog impact

No accounts.  
No data saved.  
No nonsense.

## Why I made this

Mostly to:
- I felt like shipping something
- see what happens when I actually deploy
- vibecoding seemed faster than thinking too much

It’s not meant to be perfect or universal.  
Different colleges do things differently — this just covers the common cases.

## Design

- Dark theme (on purpose)
- Works on phone, tablet, laptop
- Simple inputs, clear outputs
- A few tips so students don’t feel lost

If this saves you 5 minutes, it’s done its job.
